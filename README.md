# Expriment-on-CNN-and-DNN-regarding-visual-information

Here I have used fashion MNIST(https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) and The Sign Language Digits Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset) and have created CNN and DNN models for prediction.

By scrambling the images, we also observed that DNNs do not seem to use visual information, wheras CNNs do.
